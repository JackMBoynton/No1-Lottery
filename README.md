# No. 1 Lottery Windows Application
This was a project for OCR A-Level Computer Science where we had to write a program from any subject / topic. I chose to do a Lottery project as I felt that there was a lot of possibilities with this. Especially considering we had to have a Database included and linked too. I felt there was a lot of room for functionality such as User Accounts, Balances, Ticket Purchasing and more with this idea.

## Problem(s)
A known problem exists with this project, it is because of the nature of the database I was using and the connection type. I have included a prebuilt empty database to be used with the project. **_Please move this database from the project folder to any location you desire._** Then you will need to do as follows below.

## Steps for Fixing Connection Issues
1. First you need to drag and drop the DB folder from the root directory downloaded here into any folder on your PC except the source folder, because Microsoft just doesn't seem to accept it.

2. Second, open the .sln file from the root directory you just downloaded and click the actual project _(red arrow)_ then click the Properties option _(yellow arrow)_.

3. The new window will open, first click the Settings tab _(red circle)_ if not already selected, then you want to click the first setting _(blue circle)_, more importantly, click the 3 button icon to 'Browse' for the new data connection you moved in Step One _(green circle)_.

4. Finally, this new window will open, click the 'Browse...' button _(red circle)_. Select the database which will be in the DB folder you moved from the root directory of the project to your desired place. Finally, click Test Connection and if it succeeds which it should do, click OK.
